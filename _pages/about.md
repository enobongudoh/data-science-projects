My name is Enobong Nkpoikana Udoh. I am an MBA graduate from the university of Aberdeen, Scotland with a Bachelor of Science degree in Management Information Systems.

My interest in improving processes and decision quality from learnings, using technology, led me to the interesting path that is `data science`. I am excited about the opportunity to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can support informed decision making. I'm also a skilled communicator, an excellent project coordination with an eye for detail and a creative problem-solver who delivers value on team and individual projects.


Outside of data science, I enjoy watch tv shows, catching up with loved ones, exercising and travelling.
