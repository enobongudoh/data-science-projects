    "\n",
    "Covid-19 is an infectious respiratory diseases caused by the newly discovered Coronavirus. The novel virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, formerly called 2019-nCoV), is a family of viruses popularized by their spiky crown. The virus was first detected amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, China and was initially reported by World Health Organization on the 31st of December 2019.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this work, exploratory analysis is carried out to assess the impact of Ontario's Covid preventative solutions and restrictive measures (mobility), on the daily changes in covid cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this project will explore the following lines of inquiry with the help of a number of publicly accessible data sets: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there an observable relationship between the reported covid activities and the proposed medical solution i.e. vaccination?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is there an influence on the number of reported cases in ontario by people's activities across the days of the week?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With the government's vaccination plan, preference was given to adults who were 70 and over first, as well as those considered medically compromised. Was this as a result of the significance in the number of confirmed positive cases in the age group 70 and above?\n",

    "4. How does the proportion of affected groups compare with the those getting vaccinated?\n",

    "For this project, to gain a better understanding of the covid-19 related activities in Ontario, the datasets above were cleaned for exploration.  \n",
    "- The Ontario's Covid-19 pandemic and vaccination data contained information on the daily changes and totals of covid-19 cases, fatalities, tests, hospitalizations, criticals, recoveries, vaccinations (partial and full) and vaccines distributed, in the province.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confirmed positive cases data contained records of verified cases with fields such as, accurate episode date, case reported date, test reported date, specimen date, age group, client gender and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ontario vaccination data by age contained fields such as date, age group, total population, the proportion of each age group's population with at least the first dose and second dose of the vaccine per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The mobility data from google contained fields such as date and percent changes in movement to retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces and residential places. These changes were assessed in comparison to the baseline which was computed by google as the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3, 2020 â€“Feb 6, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data set was reviewed independently. Some columns were renamed and the unused columns were dropped. Each data set was checked for missing values, duplicates and outliers. The missing values were filled where necessary. In the confirmed cases data, only 99.14% of the data was retained as missing values and duplicated information were removed. The data sets were all indexed as time series with a uniform end date of July 17, 2021.\n",

    "### Conclusions from exploratory analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data shows that there is correlation between covid activties and the preventive solution - vaccinations. Although levels of correlation differ, total cases has a positive correlation with the totals of other activities. \n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Total fatalities has a correlation of ~0.96\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Total tests has a correlation of ~0.98\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Total hospitalizations has a correlation of ~0.50\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Total criticals has a correlation of ~0.79\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Total recoveries has a correlation of ~0.99\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Partial vaccinations has a correlation of ~0.83\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Full vaccinations has a correlation of ~0.60\n",
    "    - Total cases  vs Vaccines distributed has a correlation of ~0.83\n",
    "    \n",
    "- While there is a very low correlation between the days of the week and total cases in ontario, a bar plot shows that the daily changes in number of cases tends to differ across the different days of the week but this is insignificant for total cases. From the data, Friday, April 16 2021, is the day with the highest number of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, although the older population in Ontario are said to have a higher risk of contracting the virus, the data shows that there is a higher number of people testing positive amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite cases being higher amongst the younger population, as of July 17-2021, vaccination efforts had a higher spread amongst the older population. If events progress at this rate, it will likely slow down the speed with which the province overcomes the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, irrespective of activities slowing down and the preventative measures, such as full lockdowns and restricted movements, the number of cases in the province has continued to rise. It can also be noted that daily change in cases saw it's two major peaks during the government imposed stay-at-home order."

    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "In the event of future pandemics, to overcome it's impact faster, it is recommended that;\n",
    "- the large scale public education on hygiene measures such as; washing hands, wearing masks, sanitizing shared spaces etc, should continually be emphasized to minimize the spread of the virus.\n",
    "- the general public is continually sensitized on the need to get tested as this would reduce the chances of asymptomatic people spreading the virus.\n",
    "- the vaccination opportunities should be open to the general public, including the younger population, early. This would potentially improve the quality of results derived from the solution.\n",
    "- Analyse the impact of mobility restriction measures periodically to determine how viable that solution is. If cases tend to increase drastically at the end of lockdowns, it might be due to asymtomatic carriers suddenly mixing up with others whenever some degree of freedom is allowed. \n",
    "- Explore limiting capacity as opposed to full lockdowns during a pandemic. This would likely decrease the sudden excitement for everyone to be outside at the same time and would increase the possibility of knowing who was where and when. E.g: via the barcode registrations required by some enclosed spaces presently."
